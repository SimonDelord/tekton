Those YAML files are the various Tasks that get imported into the OCP cluster 
via ACM (e.g using ACM as a tool to provide access to developers to various Tekton components)

One task that is not here is the openshift-client Task that can be retrieved from 
https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/master/task/openshift-client/0.1

But the principle is still the same, you could upload the openshift-client Task in the proper
git repo and get ACM to dispatch it to the relevant OCP clusters.
