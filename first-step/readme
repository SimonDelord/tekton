This is the First Step of the Demo - an infra/DevOps person creates various Tekton tasks, pipelines and trigger components
and uploads them into a GitHub repo. 
All these tasks are then imported to the relevant OCP clusters via ACM.
I am using two "combined" YAML files for the import of both Pipelines.git and Triggers.git into the OCP cluster.
